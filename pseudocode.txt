Input Variables
====================================
String characterName
Int characterLevel
String className
Int conScore
Bool isHillDwarf //0 is no 1 is yes
Bool hasToughFeat //0 is no 1 is yes
Bool isAveragedOrRolled //0 is average 1 is rolled


Additional variables / structures
====================================
Dictionary for string of class and int of hit die
2D array for constitution scores and modifiers
Int hitDie
Int totalHealth 


Pseudocode
====================================

check className string for class and compare to dictionary to find out hit die
make sure class given is a real class

if (rolled) roll for level amount of times their class' hit die
if (averaged) multiply average of their class' hit die by level (if the average of their die results in a float, round up to the nearest int)

add result to totalHealth int

if hill dwarf, add 1 hp per character level to totalHealth int
if tough feat, add 2 hp per character level to totalHealth int

for constitution loop through score column of 2D array and when there is a match, check the corresponding modifier
add that modifier to totalHealth

if totalHealth <= 0 set it to 1

print out what the rolls were along with any modifiers and show the totalHealth
